# Andy Dale - Path to Probation

Welcome to Tempcover! I’m very excited to have you join us. This document is intended to give you the best start possible. It highlights things to know, people to talk to, my expectations of you and the priorities for you role. 

First things first, I am conscious that you are new to the world of insurance. This sector, and particularly short term insurance has a lot of complexity, including regulatory considerations. I have been working in insurance for most of the last 10 years, and I am still learning new things every day. I strongly encourage you to ask questions as you go, to me and everyone you meet. There is no such thing as a silly question, and it’s how you build your own expertise. 

Most importantly, know that I am here to support you and I am invested in your success. It is literally my job to make sure that you are successful and that Product at Tempcover drives positive impact! My commitment to you is that I will provide 1:1 time with you weekly, but will also be available whenever you need me. I will do all I can to unblock any hurdles you face within 24 hours, and I will always provide real-time feedback to you so there are never any surprises at the end of your probation. 

Good luck, and enjoy it!

Neil

## Navigating this document

## Your probation objectives

This is my initial view on your priorities and objectives. We will discuss and revise these and set them as formal SMART objectives for you in our 15Five platform once you have settled into life at Tempcover (after week 4). I encourage you to think about your own objectives and proposing those which you want to take forward into 15Five, including any that you come up with yourself. 

### 1. Onboard to Tempcover

- Build a strong understanding of Tempcover’s strategy and OKRs
- Understand your key responsibilities and how they align with the above Tempcover strategy
- Meet with all of the people in the **People to Meet** section below. I will help you with introductions and priorities, and who your key stakeholders are. Build deep relationships with them and spend time understanding their world and how it relates to your role.
- Learn about temporary insurance including the competitive landscape
- Demonstrate commercial awareness and the key input and output metrics that drive Tempcover’s performance

### 2. Take ownership of your Product(s) and its performance

- Build a close relationship with your team (Experiences) and your peers (Alice - Design, Olek - Data, and Petros - Engineering). Get involved in all ceremonies and actively contribute to conversations affecting your Product
- Understand the main product journeys on app and web, take the time to understand why things are the way they are today
- Understand your key product metrics, and how to self-serve in Amplitude for the core journeys. If you see a problem in the data, you don't need permission to investigate it.
- Take ownership of the conversion experimentation roadmap, and work with Alice to define the work, Olek to size the opportunities, and Petros and team to deliver. This is a great place to get started as you’ll build a deep understanding of the funnel and opportunities to make it clearer and better for customers. Work with Alice, Olek and Petros to prioritise the order of delivery. You need to ensure a constant flow of experiments, which means having a strong backlog of ‘ready for development’ work. You should target getting your first experiment live within your first 30 days.

They will provide some critical context for you. 

The strategic theme for 2026 is ‘Unlock & Go’. This reflects that there is a lot that we need to do to position Tempcover to be in the best possible position for significant future growth. There are some key things that we need to do in the first half of the year, to unlock growth in the second half of the year. 

Tempcover has three key strategic pillars for 2026: 

1. **Brand Power**
    1. Tempcover becoming the defining brand when people think of temporary insurance
2. **Returning customers**
    1. Get people to buy more policies and shift into the app
3. **Risk optimisation**
    1. Increase conversion through tailored, intelligent and personalised quote journeys, supported by strategic  cornered resource

The above work is well understood and in progress. I will spend time with you going into more detail. 

There are also the following candidates for future focus

1. **Learner drivers**
    1. Build a market-leading product for learners
2. **Annual Alternative** 
    1. Flexible insurance as an alternative to expensive annual policies

These are the potential next-step growth opportunities for Tempcover, and Product will be taking the lead on Discovery for these in 2026. Again, I will take you though these in more detail.

**Example:**
If £10m of premium incurs £6.5m in claims, the loss ratio is 65% - meaning 65% of premium went to claims and claims handling and 35% is left for expenses and profit. |

| Underwriter | The financial institution that takes on the actual risk and pays out the claims (e.g., Allianz). |
| Underwriting Criteria / Footprint / Risk appetite | The "rules" that define who we can and cannot insure (e.g., "No drivers under 18," "No Ferraris"). These can be underwriter specific |

### How we communicate and work together at Tempcover

### Communication - Slack

We use Slack for *almost everything* at Tempcover - emails are a rarity. Managing this might feel a bit overwhelming at times, as there a *lot* of channels, but I promise you’ll get used to it. Given the nature of Product’s role, you’ll be included in a lot of conversations. A couple of words of advice: 

1. Make use of the VIP facility. Mark your team and key stakeholders as VIPs so that you know to look at their messages first. Prioritise answering your team - especially where a quick message can unblock them. 
2. Star (favourite) other key channels 
3. Group similar themed channels
4. Mute channels that are less relevant
5. Set your status if you’re not available to respond (it will automatically show when you’re in a meeting)

Given our two sites in London & Fleet and partial remote working, it it important to keep communication high across Tempcover. You will find the right rhythm and balance with how you use Slack.

### Communication - video calls

Text communication is great, but it can often be easier to get the right people in a room or on a call to discuss things. Feel free to suggest this yourself, and try to make yourself available if others feel a call would be better. We use a combination of Slack Huddles for quick calls, Google Meet and Zoom.

## A guide to working with me 😀

### My Mantras

There are two mantras that you will keep hearing from me. This is based on a lot of experience, including not getting these things right myself in the past, and learning from it. When things don’t go to plan, it’s usually because one of these mantras isn’t being followed:

### Mantra 1: Visibility & Governance 👀

It is crucial to have a really high level of visibility of the work that we do in the Product team. We should be sharing early and sharing often. This could be anything from saying "Hey, we're going to start discovery on a new feature” to see whether any stakeholders might have an interest in getting involved, all the way through to "Here is how a particular thing that we have launched is performing." 

This is particularly the case when it comes to decision making. As an example, one of the primary outputs to your decision making will be the Product roadmap. Making sure the visibility is high on that roadmap is really important. However what is equally important is that people understand the rationale of the items in the roadmap and their priority order. This is where the governance piece comes in. You will be expected to make critical decisions as part of your role, so we need to ensure is that there is a really high level of governance around those decisions. This means that all relevant stakeholders across Tempcover are informed and included where appropriate. Visibility and governance are strongly connected for me. I will be asking for feedback from your key stakeholders on both of these as we move through your probation. 

### Mantra 2: Trusted Autonomy 🤝

You'll hear me talking about this more as an end destination rather than a day-one expectation. I ultimately expect you to become the absolute expert in your Product(s). You should understand the overall strategic direction of Tempcover and be able to demonstrate how your work directly connects to that strategy. You should feel that you can set the agenda for your product, and can be coming to me and saying "this is what we're going to build next, and here is why”, based on things like market insights, customer feedback, discovery and customer research, partner requirements, and the general strategic needs of the business.

Trusted Autonomy does *not* mean working in isolation. When it comes to the core strategic direction for your Products you and I will work together with others on making those decisions. 

Trusted Autonomy means that you take the lead and propose a direction with your solid rationale, but it of course remains open to conversation, additional inputs and debate. You should see one of the goals of your probation as starting to demonstrate that leadership for your Products. 

### Communicating with me

We will have a weekly 1:1 where you set the agenda. This should be primarily focused on your personal growth and how I can support you, rather than a run down on what you’re working on - visibility should already be there for me on that based on the above! On that note, please keep communication between us high, and make sure you make me aware of things as they happen. Don’t feel that you need to hold things until our 1:1 time. If you need help, a question answered, or just want to run something by me, then let me know that you’d like a few minutes. I will *always* make myself available as soon as I practically can if you need some time from me. If a quick call will unblock you, or you need more focused time from me to talk something through, just let me know and I will make it happen. 

I can be very solution focused, that comes from three decades of experience. There are probably few situations that I haven’t encountered before in one way or another 😀. However, I do expect you to challenge my assumptions. Healthy conflict and radical candour are critical for high performing teams 📈. If there is ever disagreement, my default position will usually be ‘how can we get some data to find out for sure?’. That might be data analysis, customer insight, market research, or from talking to expert stakeholders. You’ll find that bringing data to the table early will help us align quickly. You should know the intricate details of your Product better than I do.  I will be there as a sounding board, to bring healthy challenge, to guide and, yes, sometimes, to direct (I am a Director after all! 🎬).  

## Product at Tempcover

### The Product team

The small (but perfectly formed!) Product Team consists of:

- Neil Dodd - Director of Product
- Alice Osman - Lead Product Designer
- Andy Dale - Lead Product Manager 🎉
- Claire Wills-McKissick - Senior Customer Experience Manager
- Oleksandr (Olek) Yatsenko - Lead Product Analyst  - Olek is officially in the data team, but we also see him as an integral part of the Product Team!

### My goals for Product at Tempcover

- Reinstate a world-class experimentation culture.
    - When I first joined in August ‘25, business performance was not where we’d hoped. I initiated a conversion optimisation programme and we ran a few experiments that materially improved performance.
    - In Q4, we relentlessly prioritised the Returning Customer experience, at the expense of our conversion experimentation programme.
    - This year, we’ve started to run experiments again alongside larger project work, and the goal is to ensure that we always have a backlog of experiments ready for development.
- Demonstrate that Product can drive significant growth for Tempcover
    - Through a combination of conversion uplift and new product and feature ideas, we have to show that the Product team drives positive business impact. Everything we do should have value assigned to it to assist prioritisation, and then we need to prove what the value actually was. We need to bank learnings so that we keep improving our understanding of business performance and how we can drive it. Nothing should be being worked on without a hypothesis on how it positively impacts our key metrics. Note that although the value is usually going to be in £s, it won’t always be the case. For example, reducing customer contacts by offering a self service feature won’t necessarily drive revenue, but it will allow us to scale the business without needing to scale operationally.
- Define and deliver the future of insurance through risk optimisation and new initiatives such as Learner and Annual Alternative
    - This is the reason I joined Tempcover. I feel that I have unfinished business in the sector, and I believe that we have the ambition, people and belief at Tempcover that we can really make a
    difference. This is a summary of what I presented at our November All Hands (and I probably said this in our interviews too!)
    
    Firstly, I believe that Insurance is **inherently unfair**. I feel strongly about this. So, why do I believe this? I was triggered by this news article ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67991154](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67991154)), which says that Young drivers can face £3000 cost for car insurance. Here are some key figures from the article:
        1. Average premium for 17–20-year-olds up by more than £1,000 year-on-year, with some facing premiums close to £3,000
        2. For 17-year-olds, the average quoted premium is about £2,877; for 18-year-olds, around £3,162, based on [Confused.com](http://confused.com/)’s average of the best five quotes.
        
        I believe that it is unfair that the people who can afford it least pay the most. However, they are more risky. They get into more accidents. They cause more damage and injury. They make more claims. They are expensive for the insurance industry. You could argue that the industry is being very data led in its decision making.  My objection is the use of the word ‘they’. I firmly believe that not every 19 year old is a bad driver. In fact, the same person can have different risk profiles based on their situation. A 19 year old at 11am in a supermarket car park, in their mum's car with their mum sat next to them has a different risk profile to the same 19 year old at 11pm, in a supermarket car park, in a souped up hatchback with their mates in the back. 
        
        Underwriting risk decisions today are black and white and based on broad demographics, and blunt third party data enrichment tools. There is no nuance. We can change this. We can find the nuance and the grey in the black and white . The ambition is to build ‘n’ versions of Tempcover, based on a deep understanding of the person and their situation here and now, e.g. the vehicle they’re driving, the time of day, the weather, their licence length.
        
        With more nuance, we can turn a ‘no’ into an ‘absolutely not’ or, for some people, a yes. We can build the best risk decisioning engine and model that is far superior and differentiated to
        anything else out there.  If we get this right, it will be a **triple win** for our customers, our underwriting partners and us.
        
        Getting better at decision making works two ways. We also need to get better at understanding the people that we shouldn’t be selling to as well as those that we could. Our Pricing & Underwriting Team call this Revenue Protection and Revenue Generation. Both are critical. It is what makes insurance a really interesting Product to work on. We're not just trying to optimise to get as many people through the conversion funnel as possible. As a critical part of our Risk Optimisation workstream, we’re ideally looking for product changes that either reduce the loss ratio without hurting conversion OR increase conversion by identifying the 'Safe' sub-segment from those currently being declined. We're trying to optimise for getting the **right** people through the funnel. Product (i.e. you, Alice & Olek) can also help our colleagues understand why people Walkaway from our Products, to help ensure we're finding that balance between Revenue Protection and Revenue Generation.  
        
        Alongside the above workstream, which is mostly related to risk optimisation, there are two significant Product opportunities to explore. Note that these are in early discovery, and we may choose not to build them.
        
        1. Learner drivers
            1. On average, learners take 22 hours of private lessons. You will hear talk of ‘Tempable moments’ - this is definitely one of those. However, the existing short term proposition is expensive compared to other providers that give monthly subscriptions. Can we construct a better product. Also, can we make it feel to learners that we are with them and supporting them on their journey to passing their test? There’s a lot of potential opportunity here, and we’re just getting started on discovery.
        2. Annual replacement
            1. Closely related to the insurance is unfair piece is the rigidity and expense of annual insurance. There is an opportunity to build a better alternative. However, if we truly want to disrupt and succeed in the £22Bn a year market, we need to build a genuine replacement to Annual. This means appealing to a broad spectrum of the population (think 95% of UK drivers), not just to our existing demographic (who have a high loss ratio in this space). Attracting a typical ‘boring driver’ will be critical to making this a success.

### Product Roadmap

The Product Roadmap is kept in a Now / Next / Later view. We work with Marc, Giorgia and Petros to help the business understand timelines for the highest priority ‘Now’ items. 

The Roadmap is kept in two places, and it will be your job to make sure that they are in sync, as the different formats are needed for different purposes:

1. [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DJDcH3pAbz5JclcLnEYKv0zZ42NkGSdyapLMi7_lRxQ/edit?usp=sharing) - this is imported into other slide decks, so it’s important that it’s accurate
2. [Notion](https://www.notion.so/2e2f14a0e24d809faf76f3a965b43571?pvs=21) - this allows us to connect it to initiatives in the [Product Backlog](https://www.notion.so/224f14a0e24d80f5917bf370336ca057?pvs=21)

## People to meet

I appreciate that this is a lot of people (it’s most of Tempcover!), so stagger meeting them all through your probation. It will be important to build some level of relationship with each of them. Some you’ll meet as part of your work, others will inevitably reach out to you, and some you will need to arrange to meet.
