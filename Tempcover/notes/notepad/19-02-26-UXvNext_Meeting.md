Executive Summary
The meeting focused on the conceptual development of the "NextGen" project, specifically looking at the end-to-end user experience for temporary car insurance. The team reviewed the existing 12-question flow and debated whether the industry's obsession with a "quick and slick" journey has led to data gaps. A primary goal was identified: building the industry's best "Risk Decision Engine" by moving beyond simple "1 or 0" data points (like whether a license is valid) to more nuanced behavioral data (like how a person actually drives or the specific route they take).

Strategic Next Steps
Low-Fi Wireframing: Alice is assigned to create a "blank sheet of paper" wireframe in Miro. This should ignore existing technical constraints and incorporate the "Blue Sky" ideas discussed (voice notes, social connections, etc.).

Data Enrichment Research: The product team will investigate the feasibility of pulling deeper data from the DVLA (e.g., points on license) directly into the "Radar" pricing engine.

Cross-Brand Integration: Explore the potential for "Log in with U-Switch" or "Log in with Confused.com" to pre-populate user details and validate residency through existing household data.

Behavioral Discount Model: Design a concept for "Behavior-Based Discounts" where users are quoted a price, but receive a rebate or future discount based on recorded telematics data from their actual trip.

Questions & Answers
Q: What does "V Next" stand for?
A: It stands for "Version Next" (UX Version Next).

Q: Why does the duration of the policy matter so much for risk?
A: There is a statistical correlation between policy duration/frequency and risk. Long-duration policies or repeated 28-day policies on the same vehicle can indicate non-standard usage or potential fraud (e.g., trying to avoid Continuous Insurance Enforcement).

Q: What is a "Stop File"?
A: It is a database of individuals or geographic areas (like specific streets in Bradford or Birmingham) that are blacklisted due to government sanctions, abusive behavior toward staff, or extreme historical fraud rates.

Q: How could we eliminate the need for users to type their registration number?
A: The team discussed "Intelligent Connections" such as scanning an inbox/texts, using a QR code, or a social feature where you can search for a friend (e.g., "Alice") and select a vehicle they have already listed.
