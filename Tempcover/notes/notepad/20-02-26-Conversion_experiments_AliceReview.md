Meeting records [Transcript](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m) 

### Summary

Andrew Dale and Alice Osman discussed several experiments, including the "License Check Experience Improvements" aimed at reducing customer contacts by changing the driving license number (DN) check flow and consolidating decline messaging. They also reviewed the "Editable Driving License Number 'Fake Door' Test," where Andrew Dale did not fully understand the rationale, and the "Summarized Quote Before Payment Test," which yielded inconclusive user testing results due to user focus on the existing top section rather than the collapsible accordion. Alice Osman requested clarity on the next priority, particularly the "reassurance messaging" experiment, leading to a discussion about refining the hypothesis and the need for user research to validate if a lack of confidence in the provider is a problem before proceeding with an A/B test.

### Details

* **Initial Check-in and Technical Issues**: Andrew Dale and Alice Osman began the meeting by addressing technical issues, including a required browser update that interfered with joining the call ([00:00:00](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.rhzl2jh2oi)). Alice Osman noted that sometimes system updates happen automatically, causing users to drop off meetings, and Andrew Dale acknowledged they also needed to start routinely shutting down their computer on the weekend to prevent forced shutdowns ([00:02:07](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.c94c5saxu93y)).

* **Setting the Meeting Agenda**: Andrew Dale proposed reviewing the experiment specifications to understand the rationale, main hypotheses, and measurement methods, as they had not yet fully reviewed the documentation. Alice Osman confirmed they were amenable to any approach and suggested starting with the topics listed in Notion ([00:03:04](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.6kezrwipqlif)).

* **Discussion of License Check Experience Improvements**: The conversation focused on the "License Check Experience Improvements," starting with the corresponding Figma file, which Andrew Dale was initially unable to locate because it was outside of the "conversion experiments" file ([00:04:16](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.4lcvg6l18vyc)). Alice Osman updated the link in Notion, pointing to a file called "DN" (Driving License Number) on a page called "manual license uplift," specifically referring to a design named "Ghost 2.0" ([00:06:17](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.167iy91bp2f6)).

* **Reducing Customer Contacts (CX Team) and License Check Flow**: Andrew Dale summarized the context: the move to 100% license checking led to increased customer contacts due to flow issues, causing customers to see a price, undergo a license check, and then potentially see a higher price or a decline message. Alice Osman confirmed the goal was to reduce contacts to the CX team and address common issues where customers couldn't get past the license check stage ([00:07:33](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.dfvikb1dchci)).

* **Background on Driving License Check Flow Change**: Alice Osman provided background, explaining that the flow previously went "quote then DN," which was illogical because a DN check could alter the final quote. The flow was moved to "DN check then the quote" to ensure the quote was specific to the customer's driving license number ([00:10:03](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.45dlgam0x9io)).

* **Consolidating Decline Messaging**: Alice Osman explained that the decline message for the DN check was previously appearing in two places ([00:10:03](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.45dlgam0x9io)). They proposed having the decline message appear only on one screen for better data perspective and consistency, ensuring it was visible in 100% of cases ([00:11:05](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.w7bevc6r9c20)).

* **Addressing Driving License Number Input Issues**: Alice Osman raised that they also aimed to edit the driving license number input method because customers often confused the last two issue digits with the actual number ([00:11:05](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.w7bevc6r9c20)) ([00:24:43](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.90gj5cgnlwbf)). They referenced the mockups showing four input boxes to alleviate this confusion ([00:12:06](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.u4d8hmp4pv5v)).

* **Confusion Regarding Experiment Scope**: Andrew Dale and Alice Osman discussed whether the input change for the driving license number was included within the "License Check Experience Improvements". Alice Osman was unsure if this change was documented there, leading them to decide to move on to the next topic ([00:12:06](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.u4d8hmp4pv5v)).

* **Review of the Editable Driving License Number "Fake Door" Test**: The discussion shifted to the "Editable Driving License Number fake door" test, which Andrew Dale admitted they did not fully understand, especially why it was termed a "fake door". Andrew Dale also noted that the tracking was inaccurate, preventing proof of the hypothesis ([00:13:03](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.ixu76is6j4ga)).

* **Rationale Behind the Editable DN Test**: Alice Osman explained that a certain number of users complained that the pre-filled first few characters of the driving license number were incorrect and wanted to edit them ([00:14:20](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.vczfp0t72g5z)). The "fake door" concept originated from wanting to build minimal functionality to gauge the value and propensity of people wanting to change the DN, which would have been an initial expand action without a Call to Action (CTA) ([00:20:43](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.gxl9daijzguh)).

* **Functionality of the Current DN Input and Error Handling**: The current live flow allows users to hit "edit details" if the prefilled number is incorrect, which takes them back to the previous risk details screen to correct a user data input error. The core question being validated is whether users truly need editing rights to the pre-filled characters or if the issue is a user error ([00:19:32](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.h16s24c5v1zb)). The goal is to determine if the need for editable DN functionality is validated, particularly given the technical complications and future preference for scanning functionality ([00:20:43](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.gxl9daijzguh)).

* **Editable DN Next Steps and Formatting**: Alice Osman confirmed that the "editable DN" design would allow users to edit all entities of the license number. The proposed formatting, which breaks the number down into sections (e.g., surname, middle bit, last bit), is based on user testing and replicates the formula of what creates the DN, aiming to help users quickly identify data input errors ([00:22:38](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.er1znuxlb3dh)).

* **Contrasting User Error with System Error in Editable DN**: Andrew Dale questioned the consequences of allowing users to edit the DN if their input causes inconsistencies, using the example of a person using a preferred name like "Jordi" instead of the official "Jordan" ([00:28:22](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.cv26wu1166xc)). Alice Osman confirmed that if the edited information doesn't match the My License Checks, the user won't get a quote, making the measurable outcome the value of proceeding to the next step (editable DN) ([00:29:19](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.43kqkyiyi1um)).

* **Accordion Design and Components**: Andrew Dale asked about the use of different accordion styles in the designs. Alice Osman clarified that the designs use different accordions because the team lacks standard components for these elements ([00:32:05](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.c87evy475xcj)). Alice Osman expressed a preference for the plus/minus icon over arrows for accordions because arrows can be ambiguous, suggesting they are better for forward or backward navigation ([00:33:02](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.g2vv9fc05tq)).

* **Focus on Summarized Quote Before Payment Test**: The discussion transitioned to the "Summarized Quote Before Payment" experiment ([00:33:54](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.byk09jhtisxk)). Andrew Dale acknowledged that they now better understood the design, specifically that the user testing focused on the collapsible, expandable purchase summary accordion below the live top section, not the top section itself ([00:35:02](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.a42uljtdktu9)).

* **Inconclusive User Testing Results**: Alice Osman reported that the user testing results were inconclusive and did not provide clarity on which design performed better for the hypothesis of improving conversion ([00:36:25](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.ogxiohdm579z)). The testing was hampered by users focusing too heavily on the pre-existing, live top section, creating a bias and lacking focus on the accordion component ([00:35:02](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.a42uljtdktu9)) ([00:38:19](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.n5re71d175rg)).

* **Future Testing Approach (Multi-Arm Bandits)**: Alice Osman noted that the team uses "multi-arm bandits" (a multi-variant test, not just A/B) for testing ([00:36:25](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.ogxiohdm579z)). The team concluded that since the user testing was inconclusive, they needed to proceed with building the experiment to validate the hypothesis, although Alice Osman expressed worry that the proposed options might cause more friction ([00:40:55](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.ivcf4dfhfa9n)).

* **Multivariant Testing Cohort Size**: Andrew Dale asked how A/B testing cohorts are typically split. Alice Osman believed the team usually defaults to a 50/50 split for AB testing, reserving a 10% split for checking releases ([00:43:05](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.28n8ec70okp4)). Andrew Dale suggested forking a small percentage (e.g., 5%) of traffic into the multi-variant test to reduce risk and cost given the inconclusive user testing ([00:44:02](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.6k2bjhdrk0bu)) ([00:47:47](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.lpo0ghg4x6pn)). Andrew Dale committed to asking the group about the feasibility of running a smaller traffic split ([00:45:02](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.ydo9sjdx9a5l)).

* **Addressing User Testing Biases and Feedback**: Alice Osman detailed that the testing bias persisted even after redacting the numbers in the accordion, with users still focused on the top section ([00:40:02](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.vgi32vbczjah)). Users wanted more information, leading to highly varied insights, such as confusion over terms like "fully comprehensive" and the 3:30 time counter ([00:39:15](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.1emcs5r18ta3)) ([00:46:05](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.uxltelusmen4)). Andrew Dale suggested that addressing the generic improvements to the current screen should be its own separate experiment ([00:42:10](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.i4n3tigl1gsm)) ([00:47:47](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.lpo0ghg4x6pn)).

* **Defining the Process for Experiment Implementation**: Andrew Dale questioned the process for moving a finalized multivariant test (like "Summarize Quote Before Payment") from specification to development ([00:48:53](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.z0d3u5las8gh)). Alice Osman stated that this process is new, suggesting they need to set up planning meetings with Petros to define the process, outline what they are working on, and potentially write the tickets themselves for Petros to allocate ([00:50:04](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.dzqg2mbndbfr)).

* **Communication Channels**: The speakers discussed the appropriate internal channels for communicating these experiment plans ([00:50:51](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.x9in3x6at4ez)). They confirmed that the "TC Design Product Tech" channel was suitable, though Andrew Dale suggested creating a new, smaller "Product Quad" channel that includes the product leads (Alice Osman, Andrew Dale, Petros, and Oleg) and Neil for visibility ([00:52:50](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.3jh7tcqk0d4g)).

* **Alice Osman's Next Priority and Reassurance Messaging**: Alice Osman requested clarity on their next priority, specifically regarding the "reassurance messaging" experiment. Alice Osman was unsure whether to proceed with more designs and user testing, as there had been some negative stakeholder feedback ([00:55:59](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.c1qa6tdfx19r)).

* **Refining the Reassurance Messaging Hypothesis**: Andrew Dale suggested that it is probably worth testing the reassurance messaging ([00:55:59](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.c1qa6tdfx19r)). Alice Osman responded that the hypothesis needs to be refined, as removing the underwriter logo is likely not an option. The concept originated from a suggestion to build trust around underwriters, who are not always household names ([00:57:01](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.z03t1ed8mfo0)).

* **Underwriter Awareness and Testing Strategy**: The speakers agreed that awareness of the underwriters among customers is low, leading to a discussion about what to test and the desired outcome. Andrew Dale questioned whether customers even know or care that their insurance is underwritten, and whether displaying the underwriter's logo might be harming conversion ([00:58:14](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.8a1onkqwvkxg)). Alice Osman noted that regulatory requirements, specifically the FCA stipulations, necessitate clarity for the customer, emphasizing the need to show that they are the broker and not the provider ([00:59:42](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.5ufjclw1q0ii)) ([01:02:56](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.kj7sjqwfgg63)).

* **Hypothesis Validation and Preceding Research**: Alice Osman expressed concern about testing the current hypothesis, which assumes the need to increase the prominence of the underwriter logo, before validating if a lack of confidence in the provider is even a problem. Andrew Dale agreed that the current approach assumes showing the logo is the only option and questioned if prior determinations are necessary ([01:00:55](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.48cfcs9nukcc)) ([01:04:59](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.komvb5t3i9a9)). Alice Osman suggested that the current issue is a business problem requiring research, rather than an immediate A/B test, and recommended end-to-end user testing to gain wider feedback and help prioritize the list of changes ([01:02:56](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.kj7sjqwfgg63)).

* **Approach to Design and Testing Scope**: Andrew Dale expressed concern that designing the entire page at once would make it difficult to isolate what causes an uplift in conversion. Alice Osman clarified that their design process involves creating a holistic design (blue sky) and then working collaboratively to break it down into smaller, incremental tests to measure value effectively ([01:01:53](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.j888wjwlxfw)) ([01:11:25](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.m1cwbxa6val4)). They confirmed that looking at the journey's future and rolling back the design is necessary to ensure components can be reused and simplified across the user journey ([01:09:35](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.sb0ujpipjik9)) ([01:11:25](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.m1cwbxa6val4)).

* **Evaluation of Priority List and Data Needs**: The speakers discussed the current priority list, with Alice Osman questioning the validity of the current order and suggesting it was merely a first step. They suggested holding a session with "Ole" to pull top-level data, such as drop-off or bounce rates, to prioritize which pages to focus on for improvements ([01:07:00](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.pz05654vrqre)) ([01:10:22](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.cdb7sdoy76i2)). Andrew Dale agreed to add an item to the list to improve the top section of a specific page, as discussed by Alice Osman ([01:09:35](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.sb0ujpipjik9)).

* **Progress on Backlog Items**: Alice Osman provided updates on several items, noting that the breakdown cover design is complete, but requires stakeholder discussions and approval regarding what information can be pulled in, such as Trust Pilot reviews ([01:12:23](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.l7t3452mjm91)). They also mentioned that the design for persisting price and discount display has been conceptualized as a component but the test focuses on the placement of that component on the page ([01:13:32](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.nm6mpjcbop7i)).

* **Testing Strategy and Framework Utilization**: Alice Osman confirmed they are open to more testing and have developed a test plan framework that includes a generic scenario and specific questions to gauge user confidence in proceeding to purchase ([01:14:35](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.88pvh075oty8)). They noted that current user testing is focused on validating designs against different user interfaces, rather than testing the hypothesis against a control ([01:17:35](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.h3gieyqqacnr)). Andrew Dale supported the strategy of doing as much testing as possible before building to increase confidence, even if the results are inconclusive ([01:16:29](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.rdai7vehp6r)).

* **Next Steps and Access to Tools**: Andrew Dale and Alice Osman agreed to utilize the current time to solidify their testing direction. Alice Osman committed to sharing the draft test plan link with Andrew Dale and messaging the relevant person in RVU to add them to user testing, which is needed because Andrew Dale currently lacks access ([01:19:30](?tab=t.gaffnh4il0m#heading=h.ww9ohd9ueox)).
