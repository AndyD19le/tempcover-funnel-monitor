Meeting records [Transcript](?tab=t.jq4e6qspep2l) 

### Summary

Alice Osman detailed the current immature product development, design, and engineering process, noting that design is not truly embedded and the existing design system is a non-functional "brand guideline" or "brand book," which requires Alice Osman to "steal components" and break them to function in designs. Collaboration challenges include Alice Osman's minimal involvement in active development and the need to streamline designs inherited from a predecessor, "Rob," due to process gaps and siloed work, with "Approved" designs within the file signifying "Neil approved" them. Alice Osman works alongside another designer, Rory, whose title is head of marketing in UX, and clarified that the product and design team owns the components even though marketing must be consulted due to their use of landing pages.

### Details

* **Initial Process and Inquiry into Team Workflow**: Alice Osman started the session by discussing the efficiency of using her phone for recording and note-taking, noting that they find it "genius" compared to manual scribbling. They then described an ad hoc session with Harry to review the process from a board and team perspective, including how items move to production and testing ([00:00:00](?tab=t.jq4e6qspep2l#heading=h.9nwjdheje568)). Alice Osman then questioned the current state of collaboration, specifically asking about being sufficiently "in the loop," pushing the agenda, and the team's historical experience with design ([00:01:13](?tab=t.jq4e6qspep2l#heading=h.551zcwuy0oyd)).

* **Assessment of Design and Engineering Collaboration**: Alice Osman concluded that the current collective team, which is relatively new, has an immature process, and in their personal take, there is essentially no formalized process for the product, design, and engineering triad to work together effectively ([00:01:13](?tab=t.jq4e6qspep2l#heading=h.551zcwuy0oyd)). While there is a process for engineering, design is not truly embedded in it, which Alice Osman attributes to historical separation where design functioned as a separate entity. They noted that the team is open and desires the clarity and validation that the design process can provide, despite previous practices where design was not prioritized ([00:02:11](?tab=t.jq4e6qspep2l#heading=h.nulaq6v4c4i3)).

* **Design System and Documentation Standards**: Discussion of the design framework revealed that the deliverables are "completely variable," confirming the lack of a true process. Alice Osman noted that the existing design system is more like a "brand guideline" or "brand book" and is not a functional or "working file" that provides value for them ([00:03:31](?tab=t.jq4e6qspep2l#heading=h.rvvwp0c3l8so)). Alice Osman currently "steals components" from this "brand refresh working file" but must break them to make them functional in their designs ([00:04:37](?tab=t.jq4e6qspep2l#heading=h.u9i358822n0p)).

* **Internal Ownership and Marketing Relations**: Alice Osman clarified that they work alongside another designer, Rory, whose title is head of marketing in UX ([00:04:37](?tab=t.jq4e6qspep2l#heading=h.u9i358822n0p)). The existing design system was created as a replica following a quick rebrand and was built in "builder," which is primarily used by marketing for self-service front-end homepage needs. If a component were to be changed, marketing would be consulted but would not ultimately decide, meaning the product and design team owns the component, although marketing must be informed because they use landing pages to push traffic ([00:05:33](?tab=t.jq4e6qspep2l#heading=h.4yfqwkgci6jt)).

* **Conversion Experiments and Involvement in Active Development**: Alice Osman noted that the team is open to suggestions, citing a conversion uplift test where they pitched removing the duration, a concept previously supported by a contract designer and product lead ([00:07:33](?tab=t.jq4e6qspep2l#heading=h.s9qaaearmqjr)). They admitted that their current involvement in active development is minimal ([00:08:25](?tab=t.jq4e6qspep2l#heading=h.v217z9z3892l)). Alice Osman described their position as being "a little bit of the weirdo in the corner on standups" because they don't say much ([00:07:33](?tab=t.jq4e6qspep2l#heading=h.s9qaaearmqjr)).

* **Returning Customer Project and Design Adoption**: Alice Osman explained that when they joined, the team was working on "returning customers," refactoring the login experience to be consistent across devices, a phase one release that is still pending ([00:08:25](?tab=t.jq4e6qspep2l#heading=h.v217z9z3892l)). They inherited a design file under a project titled "return user experiences (Rob)," where "Rob" was the preceding contractor. Alice Osman adopted this file, which contained "gray icons" representing Rob's initial processes for phase one, phase two (moving login higher), and phase three (creating a full login experience) ([00:09:30](?tab=t.jq4e6qspep2l#heading=h.rmzcizl642gv)).

* **Streamlining Designs and Process Gaps**: Alice Osman stated that they found elements in the inherited design file that "fundamentally doesn't work," leading them to create a "phase one beta source of truth" that is ready for development ([00:09:30](?tab=t.jq4e6qspep2l#heading=h.rmzcizl642gv)). The lack of process meant that the predecessor worked in a silo, presenting designs after completion, which then led to conversations about missing elements, such as instances for consumers, guests, and discounts. Alice Osman clarified that "Approved" designs within the file mean that "Neil approved" them ([00:10:40](?tab=t.jq4e6qspep2l#heading=h.nw0akjz33edr)).
