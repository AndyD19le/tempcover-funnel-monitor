Executive Summary
The meeting focused on establishing a more robust product development process, specifically addressing a disorganized backlog inherited from previous staff. The team discussed the transition to using Notion as a "source of truth" and debated the appropriate level of detail required for specification documents (specs). A key theme was the need to balance high-level strategic initiatives with rapid "conversion experiments" while ensuring that the engineering team (led by Petros) has clear, actionable tickets.

Strategic Next Steps
Backlog Review: A dedicated session is scheduled for next Friday to clean up the "Historic" and "Project Initiatives" columns, removing obsolete items and re-validating others with the CX and Dev teams.

Conversion Pipeline: The goal is to maintain a "ready" queue of five conversion experiments at all times to ensure the development team always has a validated task to pull next.

Template Standardization: The team will experiment with different Notion templates to find a balance between the hyper-detailed "Harrison" style and lighter versions for simple UI tweaks.

Impact Analysis: New experiments will now require an "Analytics" section and prior consultation with Oleg to understand potential uplift before a full spec is written.

Questions & Answers
Q: What is the current issue with the design system and backlog?
A: The existing backlog is in a state of "immaturity" and hasn't been reviewed in months. It contains many "made-up scenarios" and siloed work from previous contractors that don't reflect current user data or technical constraints.

Q: Who owns the technical "sorting out" of the tech stack?
A: Mark (COO) has been given the specific OKR to "sort out the tech," working alongside Geo and the engineering teams to address long-standing technical debt.

Q: How will the team handle the "Next Gen" project vs. smaller experiments?
A: While major initiatives like "Unified UX" or "Next Gen" are aspirational, the team agreed that conversion experiments must continue to run in parallel so that smaller, high-value wins aren't parked during long development cycles.
