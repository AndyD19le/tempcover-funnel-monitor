# Onboarding Meeting Notes: Day 1 (Full Session)
**Date:** Monday, February 16, 2026  
**Participants:** [User] & Manager  
**Key Themes:** Conversion Math, 100% License Checking Impact, and the "Keep with the App" Strategy.

## 1. Executive Summary
The primary theme of Day 1 was the transition from technical migration to **commercial impact**. The business is currently in an "Unlock" phase—clearing technical debt and stabilization—to prepare for a "Go" phase of growth in the second half of 2026. 

A major shift occurred recently with the move to **100% License Checking**, which had a significantly higher impact on conversion (23%) than the budgeted (12.5%). This has resulted in the business tracking behind budget. Success in this role requires a deep understanding of the "Value of a Point" (1% conversion = £250k/month) and a strategic push to migrate customers from high-cost "Paid Search" to the high-retention "Mobile App" ecosystem.

## 2. Commercial Reality: The "Double Whammy"
* **100% License Checking:** Moved the industry to a "level playing field." Previously, the company benefited from not checking licenses (attracting customers who couldn't get quotes elsewhere). Now, conversion has taken a **23% hit** because customers are shopping around or being blocked.
* **Session Impact:** It wasn't just conversion that dropped; total sessions are down because high-frequency returning customers (who are most affected by license checks) are not returning.
* **The "Unlock and Go" Strategy (from CCO Guildsh):**
    * **H1 (Unlock):** Fix the tech (get off legacy Tesla/V4), improve conversion, and align with underwriters.
    * **H2 (Go):** Push brand marketing once the "leaky bucket" (conversion) is fixed.

## 3. The Math of Product Success
* **The Value of 1%:** One percentage point of conversion is worth roughly **£250,000 per month**.
* **2026 Targets:** * **Conversion:** Aiming to move from a baseline of ~18-19% to **21%** by year-end through experimentation.
    * **Frequency:** Aiming to move from 2.6 policies per customer to **2.8** by December (and 3.0 by 2030).
* **LTV (Lifetime Value):** Customers coming via **Paid Search** are not profitable until their **6th policy**. This is why moving them to the App is critical to eliminate recurring acquisition costs.

## 4. Strategic Philosophy: "Win with Web, Keep with the App"
* **Front of Mind at the Point of Need:** The goal is to break the cycle of users going to Google every time they need temporary insurance. 
* **App Engagement:** 95% of App policies come from returning customers. The strategy is to acquire them via Web ("Win"), then cross-sell the App ("Keep") to ensure they have "Temp Cover in their pocket" for future needs (e.g., students coming home, sunny weekends).
* **Unified UX:** Removing friction like "Reason for Cover" is being questioned. If it doesn't provide underwriting value, it should be removed to speed up the journey.

## 5. Technical & Tooling Landscape
* **Legacy vs. New:** * **Tesla/Motor:** Legacy systems.
    * **Drive/New Web:** New platform.
    * **Insurer API:** Masking the slow V4 backend.
* **Data Tools:**
    * **PowerBI:** Used for the "DPR" (Daily Performance Report). Note: You must switch to the "Temp Cover" tenant to see reports.
    * **Amplitude:** Used for session-to-policy conversion. *Annoyance:* App and Web are currently in separate projects.
    * **Demographics:** iOS traffic is roughly 3x higher than Android, likely due to a younger skewing demographic.

## 6. Questions & Answers

**Q: Who are the key people for commercial awareness?**
**A:** Primarily the manager, but data feeds from Sarah Dashwood (Finance models) and Anna (Finance).

**Q: Is "Pacing" purely reporting, or is it for planning?**
**A:** Reporting in the meeting; planning happens in the follow-up conversations to address budget gaps.

**Q: Are we clawing back the full 23% impact or just the delta from our 12.5% prediction?**
**A:** We are clawing back toward our goal of 21% conversion. Currently, we are seeing some silver linings, with some days already hitting 20%.

**Q: Why is the LTV value for "Confused.com" pink/negative?**
**A:** It was a formatting quirk in the TLT deck; it was updated to pink in later versions. It represents the high cost of acquisition on aggregator channels.

**Q: How do I handle testing on different devices?**
**A:** The company will provide a phone for whichever OS you don't currently have (iOS or Android) to ensure you can test both experiences.
