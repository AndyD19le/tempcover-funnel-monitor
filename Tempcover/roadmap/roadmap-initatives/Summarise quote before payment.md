# Summarise quote before payment

## Project Overview
The payment screen is the last screen in our conversion funnel, but it does not reinforce what the customer is about to purchase. There is a belief that we could provide more reassurance at this stage, by playing back a customer’s demands and needs prior to payment.

## Slack Extracts
**Friday 20th Feb**

Hello everyone. I'm starting to focus on items in the Project Initiatives Backlog starting with Summarise Quote. Having reviewed the user testing and following conversation with Alice, we agreed that the outcome is somewhat inconclusive. As we have no clear direction we propose the following

**Approach**
The Plan: Develop both versions to let live data drive the final decision.
Risk mitigation: I propose a multi-variant test where we divert ~20% of purchase page traffic to the experiment, further splitting that segment into Control, Version A, and Version B.
@neil.dodd, are you supportive of this direction? @petros and @oleksandr.yatse103850, is this split-testing structure feasible from an implementation and tracking standpoint?



**Next Steps**
Sizing: @petros, what is our standard process for sizing work before commitment to ensure the ROI of building two approaches makes sense here?
Sign-off: @Andy Dale, should take the lead on getting the spec doc signed off by all stakeholders?
Once signed off, what is the best way to move Alice’s designs onto our team board and kick off the engineering briefing?

@Alice Osman, is there anything else required in your design files prior to hand over to Petros and team?

## Notes
![alt text](../../notes/notepad/notepad_Images/App-Quote.png)
- This is the app quote screen 
  - Tagged as quote_display in amplitude
  - Once the user has hit continue then that is quote selected
- It is assumed (by me), that at this point in time the key metric we are looking to improve it quote displayed to quote selected
- All of the reasons that a user may drop out at the quote display to quote selected page
  - blah
  - blah
